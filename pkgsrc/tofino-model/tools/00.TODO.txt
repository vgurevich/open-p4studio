Completed as of Sep2014
-----------------------
1. ExactMatch, ProgrammableHash, InputXbar, MultiWay, WideMatch
2. TcamMatch, WideTcamMatch, MultiRangeMatch with all DirtCAM modes
   - NB TCAM MultiRangeMatch - was supposed to be later phase - DONE in Phase2
3. Gateway Tables
4. Immediate actions within match overhead fields

Completed as of Dec2014
-----------------------
1. Immediate data into Action HV Bus config
2. Hacktion RAMS/Poor Man's Selection Tables

Completed as of Jan2015
-----------------------
1. TCAMs with no tind - single actionbit payload



Waiting for registers
---------------------
1. Config register versioning 
3. Logical table fan out config - what used to be match_to_logical_table_icxbar



Not yet implemented - this phase
--------------------------------
2. Deparser2
3. Connecting action addresses to action rams
   using overflow bus (RAM SwitchBox I) 
4. Other programming RAM Data Bus HV SwitchBox
5. Config register versioning
6. Stashes

Software features
-----------------
1. PHV/Table name lookup to enhance model debug

Not yet implemented - later phases
----------------------------------
1. MAP RAMs + read/write mems
2. Statistics/Meters
3. Stats/Meter ALU
4. Stateful tables, Stateful ALU
5. EndOfPacket BUS
6. Virtual addressing
7. Selection tables - resilient hashing
8. LR(t)
9. DMA
10. Learn filter (partially done)
11. Smart Engines
12. ECC



Will never be implemented?
--------------------------
1. Ternary match within SRAM!?


Other discrepancies from H/W
----------------------------
1. Zero-time - everything happens in zero-time
   No attempt at moment to model timing
   No attempt to model intra-MAU stage pipeline
2. Ingress/Egress packet pairs processed by MAUs get executed 
   by each MAU stage simultaneously irrespective of whether 
   the ingress and egress pipe have differing dependencies
   and hence different delay characteristics
